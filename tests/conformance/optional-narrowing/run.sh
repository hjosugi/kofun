# Optional narrowing (#312). The contract this gate holds the frontend to:
#
#   - the four recognized comparison shapes narrow, and only on their own edge;
#   - a definitely-returning guard carries the opposite edge past it;
#   - every listed invalidation rule rejects an unsafe use of `x` as `T`;
#   - the declared type stays `Optional(T)` through assignments and joins;
#   - unsupported shapes stay errors rather than optimistic assumptions;
#   - nothing here claims a runtime representation.
#
# Each refusal below is paired with a positive counterpart in `positive.kofun`,
# so a refusal proves the rule fired rather than proving narrowing never
# worked in the first place.
