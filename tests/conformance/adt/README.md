# Bounded nominal ADT frontend

This issue #328 gate parses and type-checks one deliberately small Stage 2
surface: non-generic top-level sum types with at least two flat constructors.
A constructor has either no payload or one named `Int` payload. Functions in
the gate return one constructor expression and produce typed textual IR only.

The frontend is two phase. It first collects all ADT and constructor
declarations, then resolves function bodies, so `present` in
`maybe_int.kofun` can use `Present` before the `MaybeInt` declaration. The IR
stores a nominal `adt:<name>` ID and constructor `(AdtId, local-index)` ID at
both declarations and uses, plus exact byte spans. These bounded single-file
IDs are replaced by production ModuleId/NamespaceId/SymbolId values when #111
integrates the table into the general resolver.

There is intentionally no value layout, allocation, matching, interpreter,
C/native/Wasm lowering, or runtime representation. #120 owns layout, while
#73/#93/#118 consume the typed constructor table for patterns,
exhaustiveness, and lowering.

Run:

```sh
sh tests/conformance/adt/run.sh
```
